Need to figure out how to setup the code review progress.



GIT Cheat Sheet

git branch : list branch names
git branch <name>: create a new branch
git checkout <name>: switch to (check out) a bookmark/branch
git branch -d <name>: delete a branch


git commit: commit a change
git commit -a --amend: modify a commit

git push: to land a diff to branch

pull request: create a pull request, for code review
merge the checkin master branch.
